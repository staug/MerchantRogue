BUG Listing

TileMap:
* when the map is regenerated, old doors may be kept [FIXED]
* piece of furniture may prevent the movement as they appear just near the door [FIXED]
* room generation: sometime the inner rooms are united by one corner only, this prevents the possibility of moving
* corner walls not showing correctly (implement smoothwall function, check that the wall images are correct)

GUI:
* If a textbox is moved, then its text is not shown
* The text put in a text box also impacts the screen
* The Kenney Container doesn't draw things as it should: h_align is not working
* The Kenney Container doesn't draw things as it should: resize problem
